Hello
This is my first project using an API
I used Google's QuickStart Java API which allows me to retrieve data from a specified Google Spreadsheet.
My friends and I wanted to keep track of who was keeping (and not keeping) up with their diet, so we created a spreadsheet to track the data. I decided to  use this spreadsheet to graph our progress throughout the year.
I know that using QuickStart requires "Gradle", but I don't remember how that works and which of the many "gradle" or "gradle build" file is the right/necessary one.
This project was a good introduction to using APIs as well as working with (Java) GUI.
